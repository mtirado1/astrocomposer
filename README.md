Astro Composer is a web-based planetary system design tool. Unlike a physics simulator, orbits are defined parametrically and are immune to perturbations. This ensures stability and consistency, however, orbits may not be stable on a real environment.

## Features

* Web-based, no download required!
* 3D Keplerian orbits with support for all orbital elements and nested bodies (moons and satellites)
* Rotate, zoom, and focus on objects.
* Orbits are parametric and unchanging.
* Body attributes such as name, color, size, axial tilt, and rotation period.
* Support for custom time and distance units.
* Save/Load systems for future use.
